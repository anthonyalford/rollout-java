This project is a read-only client for [rollout](https://github.com/FetLife/rollout/), except that it uses
[Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) as the backend store instead of [Redis](http://redis.io/). At Librato, we
plan to use this along side of the [rollout-zk](https://github.com/papertrail/rollout-zk) plugin.

## Getting started
